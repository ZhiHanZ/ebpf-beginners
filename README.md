# The Beginner's Guide to eBPF

ebpf.py is the code I write during my talk at [eBPF Summit 2020](https://ebpf.io/summit-2020/): [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lizrice/liz-rice-beginners-guide-to-ebpf). I've also done a similar talk using Go, and you'll find the code [here](https://github.com/lizrice/libbpfgo-beginners).

You'll find more Python code examples in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/lizrice/47ad44a15cce912502f8667a403f5649)
